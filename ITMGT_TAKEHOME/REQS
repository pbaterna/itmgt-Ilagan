1. Create a set of Corporate Website mockups for the company Digital Espresso.
Prepare at a minimum the following files:
• index.html
• aboutus.html • products.html • branches.html
Make sure that each page has the following: - standard header with logo (choose any royalty- free images or logos related to coffee) - navigation bar with links to the following: - Home - Prod- ucts - Branches - About - brownish-red background color - standard footer
2. For products.html:
• Create a table containing coffee products. You may use the products from the earlier exer- cises.
• Embed one image per product in the table.
• Make the name of the product clickable.
• Create one html file per product. Clicking on the product name from the previous step
should load the specific product html page. Each product html page should either have a link to go back to the products.html page. Note also that all the pages must follow the standard elements mentioned in 1) (standard header with logo, nav bar, footer, etc.).
3. Place all your files in a folder which you will then commit to your GitHub repositories.
4. Notify me via email at jbilagan@ateneo.edu of your upload to GitHub.
